changes:
  - rscdel: Removes shuttle previewing from the admin shuttle manipulator.
  - refactor: Shuttles now load independently, instead of through one single port
      specified in the shuttle subsystem for reasons beyond my comprehension.
  - bugfix: Fixed the bug where you spawn on the wrong ship (caused by people trying
      to create two ships at the sameish time)
