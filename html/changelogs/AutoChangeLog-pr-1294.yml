delete-after: true
changes:
  - tweak: admin aheal proc moved to the right click options on mobs
  - code_imp: the insert mutant organs part of regenerate organs no longer drops your
      previous version on the ground if you had one. if you have a tail or wings,
      it will get replaced by your default and delete the old. if you're missing the
      organ entirely, you just get a new one
  - admin: admins who are trying to aheal just right click a mob/player/carbon/pet
      and select rejuvenate.
