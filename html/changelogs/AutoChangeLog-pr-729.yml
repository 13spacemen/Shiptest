changes:
  - tweak: Loadouts are now limited by a config-set number instead of the amount of
      metacoins you could spend.
  - tweak: All loadout items spawn in a box now instead of attempting to equip stuff.
      meh.
  - rscdel: Metacoins and Antag Tokens (latter never used)
  - rscdel: Custom OOC colours/extra character slots have been removed. Sorry, but
      they just don't work now.
  - server: SQL change dropping metacoins/antag tokens, updates config with max loadout
      items value
